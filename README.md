# Gamified Todo Tasklist

**Public demo:** [Hosted on Vercel](https://todo-tasklist-one.vercel.app/)

## Overview

This is a **gamified Todo Tasklist application** I developed initially for personal use. It combines task management with game-like elements such as **experience points, levels, and unlockable badges**, making everyday task tracking engaging and interactive.  

The project serves as a **portfolio showcase**, demonstrating my skills in:

- Frontend development with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**  
- Dynamic UI rendering and state management  
- DOM manipulation, event handling, and interactive components  
- Local data persistence using **localStorage**  
- Gamification design for user engagement  


## Features

- **Category-based task organization**  
- **Daily tasks** with automatic reset  
- **Leveling system**: tasks earn XP and trigger level-ups  
- **Badge collection** for milestones and achievements  
- **Skin/theme switching**  
- **Responsive and interactive UI** with hover tooltips and animations  
- **Confetti animation** for level-up celebrations  


## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3** - layout, styling, and responsive design  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** - dynamic rendering, event handling, and local storage management  
- **CSS animations** - subtle interactions and visual feedback  
- **No backend required** - fully client-side application
